          I’m a motivated Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, currently pursuing my B.Tech at Malla Reddy University (CGPA 8.11). My journey is grounded in strong fundamentals across data structures, algorithms, and full‑stack development, and propelled by a deep curiosity for how intelligent systems can augment human capability. I thrive at the intersection of applied research and product building—turning ideas into reliable, user‑centric tools.

          Recent work spans collaborative platforms and ML‑powered applications: from a real‑time Study Buddy hub with chat, screen sharing, and voice; to Comic‑Sync, a synchronized virtual browser for shared exploration and media; to AI assistants that blend OpenAI with visual intelligence via Imagga; and a disease‑prediction web app that addresses Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s using classical ML. Along the way, I’ve built an industrial‑grade toolkit—Python, MySQL, ML/DL, Generative AI, RAG, Git/GitHub, HTML/CSS—and earned certifications from NVIDIA, Google Cloud, and AWS that sharpen my prompt design and LLM application skills. I’m excited by ambitious problems, clean engineering, and creating AI experiences that feel simple, powerful, and trustworthy.
